<h2>NEW YORK<br /><br />
THE CITY OF VIOLENT CONTRASTS</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">N</span>EW YORK is preëminently the City of Violent Contrasts. Towering shafts
of brick and stone and steel, soaring traceries of cables, derricks,
girders and electric signs, smooth stretches of gray asphalt, subway and
sewer excavations, broad harbors and stately ships, oily canals and
garbage dumps, classic columns, gilded domes, palaces and shanties,
parks and fountains, factory chimneys and gas tanks; these are a few of
the items that occur in this as in other cities, but nowhere else are
these and other manifestations of beauty and ugliness, prosperity and
squalor brought into such vivid and striking relief, and of no other
city can we say with equal truth that it defies the effort to summarize
briefly its typical characteristics. Fragments and details suggestive of
widely differing phases of its life persistently force themselves into a
single picture without regard to orderly classification or proper
dramatic sequence.</p>

<p>Appreciation of the beauty of nature as undisturbed by man seems
inherent in our race, but man in his material progress is constantly
defacing nature, constantly destroying, constantly substituting forms
and arrangements dictated by utility, not by beauty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> shocking to
our finer instincts. Then imagination steps in and gradually invests
these new forms with new meanings derived from history, logic, romance,
symbolism and pure poetic fancy. Some are condemned and discarded as
unnecessary or useless, while others at first glance equally ugly
acquire a significance and a soul. Of him who would interpret such a
theme as New York our first demand must therefore be prophetic vision.</p>

<p>To the artist who seeks to penetrate the outer surfaces of his subject
and to suggest and interpret an activity, a creative power, a vastness
of scale and a variety of functions beyond human power to portray,
charcoal is a most, perhaps the most, inspiring medium. It is surely the
medium that most readily lends itself to the simultaneous expression of
form, mass, line and tone.</p>

<p>Hopkinson Smith once said that Venice is nothing but air and water.
There all else has been so softened and moulded and enveloped as to
become part and parcel of sea and cloud. The portrayal of this is
preëminently a painter’s job. But New York, in addition to being a lot
of other things, is a Venice in the making, and all the ugly
paraphernalia by means of which this making is slowly going forward, all
the unlovely processes, physical and chemical, structural and
commercial, must be recognized and expressed and by the light of poetic
vision be made a part of its beauty and romance.</p>

<p>A painter might perhaps strive to envelope and obscure whatever seemed
objectionable in a glory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> color. An architect might lay undue stress
upon the many examples of distinction in the work of his craft, which
are often all but details in a vast scheme. The pictorial expression of
New York requires a blending of the view points of the painter and the
architect in which both contribute to an image of something not yet
realized, perhaps never to be fully realized, and help in dramatizing
the struggle towards that thing.</p>

<p>Peter Marcus is a painter not an architect, but he is also a designer
experienced in the goldsmith’s craft and there is evident in these
charcoal studies a pleasure in the delineation of the tracery of bridge
cables and trusses, derricks, scaffolding and electric signs, that in
contrast with his broad and greatly simplified expressions of
architectural form and detail, adds vastly to the eloquence of his work.
Furthermore, he is a native of New York as his parents were before him,
and the slow development by which New York has climbed upward has been
part and parcel of his life. These are the days of a premature
development or forcing of the artistic personality, usually expressed at
some sacrifice of the prevailing characters and sentiment of his
subject.</p>

<p>To my mind the most distinctive quality of these drawings is found in
the complete subjection of the artist to the spirit of the thing
represented.</p>

<p>Lower Manhattan from the harbor, from Brooklyn, from across the Hudson
and from the air has been exploited to such an extent as to destroy for
the native New Yorker much of the impressiveness of this majestic
panorama, but lower Manhattan as seen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span> within by the man in the
street has a different kind of impressiveness and pictorially has
hitherto been somewhat neglected. Five drawings are devoted to this
theme&mdash;“Lower Broadway,” “Wall Street,” “The City Hall,” “The Tombs,”
and “Exchange Place.” These five drawings as a group seem to me to
represent the culmination of the artist’s achievement. They show a
simplicity and ease of method, a definite conception and an admirable
sureness of values and textures. In imaginative power and sinister
suggestion, “Exchange Place” brings to mind Bochlin’s “Isle of the Dead”
and it is not like that, a creation of the imagination but a truthful
characterization of locality. A second group of five are “The
Metropolitan Tower,” “Times Square,” “Grand Central Station,” “The
Municipal Building,” and “The Cathedral on the Avenue.”</p>

<p>As these take us further up town into wider streets and more extended
surfaces of sky, distance and silhouette become increasingly important
in their composition, and what we lose in concentration we gain in tonal
interest.</p>

<p>“The Old Bridge,” “Washington Bridge,” “Queensboro Bridge,” and “The
Viaduct,” fall naturally into a third group. Here we have a different
manifestation of energy, the architecture of the engineer, crisp and
nervous in rendering, beautifully expressive of structure unadorned.</p>

<p>If in the drawings thus far mentioned certain qualities of Piranesi,
Méryon and Brangwyn are brought to mind; in “High Bridge,” “The
Soldiers’ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span> Sailors’ Monument,” “Hell Gate Bridge,” “Grant’s Tomb,”
and “The Cathedral on the Heights,” there is equally a suggestion of
Whistler. Less vigorous than the others in draughtsmanship, they are
full of the suggestion of subdued color. By reason of the more subtle
quality of their rendering, they lend themselves less readily to
reproduction but even the reproductions convey beautiful impressions of
shadowy foliage and quiet waters, bare, wind-swept branches and lonely
spaces.</p>

<p>It is safe to predict that if he continues his interest in charcoal as a
medium, Peter Marcus will gradually and naturally acquire a more
characteristic personal manner, but it will come from ease of mastery
not from assumed eccentricity, and whatever he may achieve in future
this series of drawings will stand as the most comprehensive and broadly
discerning study of New York in its entirety that has yet been made.</p>

TIMES SQUARE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>IMES SQUARE is at the juncture of Broadway, Seventh Avenue and
Forty-second Street. It is the very heart of uptown Broadway. Not the
downtown Broadway of finance and of towering buildings, but the Broadway
of theatres, restaurants, gay crowds and bright lights. It is bustling,
congested, whirling. It is in a constant state of being rebuilt and
repaired. Its sidewalks are littered with timbers, pipes, derricks and
showy women. One hears jazz music and Klaxtons. It is the playground of
the pleasure seeker, the battleground of the taxis, the dream of the
chorus girl on the road, and the nightmare of the traffic cop. It is
white lights, green lights, red lights,&mdash;flashing, spinning and winking.
It is noise, crowds, motion. Sun and storm, day and night it roars
along, churning,&mdash;a whirlpool in a mighty river. Incongruous, incessant,
enormous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span></p>

LOWER BROADWAY</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE changes in New York in the last hundred years have been almost
fabulous and yet the greatest of all perhaps has been lower Broadway.
The proud steeple of Trinity Church once dominated a scene of fashion.
It is now surrounded, dwarfed, overshadowed. Once Beaux and Belles, in
Brummel-like hats and directoire skirts, came grandly here to
worship,&mdash;and meant it. To-day, one picnics in the church yard and eats
luncheon bananas on the graves. The enormous buildings of commerce,
finance and trade are filled to overflowing. Here is progress, wealth
and unlimited resource. It is a tremendous hive full of golden honey.
And it is doubtless very good. But it is also good that this small
church of a bygone time, still stands undaunted,&mdash;respected among these
colossal towers; and that it still brings from the past some of that
calm strength that is of even more lasting stuff than the masonry of the
church itself, and that through it, the spirit of Old New York still
“carries on” in Lower Broadway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span></p>

EXCHANGE PLACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">R</span>UNNING east from Broadway, just below Wall Street, is Exchange Place.
It is a narrow street and a short, but it is not a little street. Huge
buildings are its walls, which seem almost to meet overhead. Straight up
they tower, face to face, staring at each other with countless eyes.
Daily into these few buildings come thousands and thousands of people:
old and young, gay and sad, financiers and office boys,&mdash;to work. It is
a good-sized town in one street. It is a veritable cañon of the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span>NE of the “Views of New York” most often pictured and most often
snapped by amateur photographers is that of lower Manhattan as seen from
a distance. And yet from a painting, photograph or drawing, who can feel
what it is? As with pictures of the Grand Cañon, it seems impossible to
realize the scale or to give the sense of its enormous size. To know
what it is, one must have seen it. A picture, in this case, can only
serve to refresh the memory of the man who knows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

THE CITY HALL</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">N</span>OTHING better exemplifies the growth of New York than does the City
Hall, standing as it does almost in the shadow of the Municipal
Building. In the old days when it was the principal structure on City
Hall Park, its three stories afforded ample room in which to carry on
the city’s affairs. It now houses only four offices, including that of
the Mayor and that of the Art Commission. The other city offices, and
their number is astounding, are elsewhere. But although the city has
grown beyond recognition, the City Hall has proudly kept its place, and
is honored as is a venerable old man, a bit less active than he was
perhaps, but still the dignified head of a noble house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span></p>

WALL STREET</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">H</span>ERE is the force of the sea and the romance of a fairy tale. Here
immense fortunes are won in a day and lost in less, and the hopes and
savings of years vanish in an hour. Here are bank messengers who become
millionnaires overnight and capitalists who awake penniless. It is the
market of the whole country and of others. Here are corn and wheat
heaped in huge confusion, millions of bales of cotton and barrels of
oil, high-piled above the sky-scrapers. Railroads, steamers, banks and
bullion; raw gold and ore, coal, silver and copper, mounting to the
clouds in glimmering pinnacles and smoking hills. And through it all and
around it all, pulses the restless swing and change, the tireless tide
of “the street.”</p>

<p>And the traders! Giants and pygmies. Tumbling over each other, swarming,
pushing, struggling. Here holding up a million head of cattle to the
highest bidder, there beating down the price of a small nation. Here is
a man beaten by a crowd for buying oil and there is another lying dead
because he sold it. And away over there runs a little man who has
succeeded in stealing a pig and is now scurrying off with it to safety.</p>

<p>This mountainous market of hopes and of nations, of success and failure,
of tragedy and comedy, of ships, steam, mines, and the lives of men,
towering phantom-like and vast,&mdash;is Wall Street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span></p>

THE OLD BRIDGE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">B</span>ROOKLYN BRIDGE the first bridge between Manhattan and Long Island. The
day of its opening was one of great public enthusiasm. Parties were
given for walking or driving across the bridge, and that night half New
York and Brooklyn were on the house-tops to watch it illuminated by
fire-works. In those days it was called “<i>The</i> Bridge.” But now since
the Manhattan, the Williamsburg and the Queensboro bridges have been
added to the East River giants, it has become “The <i>Old</i> Bridge,” a name
meaning many things to those who have known it from its beginning. Its
erection was a long step towards close relationship between New York and
the whole of Long Island.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span></p>

exterior wall and “Bridge of Sighs” make one remember the lugubrious
histories of the Doge’s Palace and of the Tour de Nesle. Those inside
bear the double burden of being imprisoned and of knowing that close
about them is all the life of the great city: its lights, its

stare through his horn-rimmed spectacles and how his dear old heart
would thump under his brass-buttoned coat! How he would pinch himself
and wonder what it all could mean! What was that enormous shaft all
white and glowing in the afternoon, rising eight hundred feet or eight
thousand to the very sky? What were those towers, spires and turrets,
soaring above the clouds, the brilliant sunlight gilding their countless
feathers of steam and decking their phantom minarets with myriad
candles? What <i>could</i> it mean? Had he landed on Manhattan or was this
some island built by fairies or by elves? Nay, this place was far too
fair for that, and must be then the work of witchcraft and the devil. Or
was it, after all, the same old place that he had known, but grown and

NEW YORK FROM FULTON FERRY</h2>

under the spell of its incalculable weight, its stupendous mass of iron,
brick and stone. It is oppressive, ominous. One feels the past, the
present and the future; and the tremendous forces which must have worked
together to produce this titanic offspring, to have spawned this
mountain of precipices. One feels the hidden activity, the pitiless
struggle going on beneath; yet a few puffs of smoke are all that betray
the smouldering of the mighty fires. One lets one’s mind sink into the
vast depths between, to see little humanity running here and there like
ants amid the tangle of wires, tunnels and pipes. Little humanity that
built it all.</p>

<p>In the past, church spires rose majestic above the surrounding city. Now
they are lost. The buildings of commerce, creeping high and higher, have
struggled upward, climbing upon one another’s backs, and mounting each
on the shoulder of each, in their ceaseless effort to be the tallest
among their fellows. And just as it is among men and the rulers of men,
as surely as one has gained the supremacy, has come another to surpass
him, swinging upward yet another fifty, one hundred, or two hundred
feet, and from their thousand brazen throats has boomed again the cry,
“Long live the king!”</p>

<p>Eight hundred feet towers the monarch of to-day. He is called
“Woolworth,” and twelve thousand men live daily in his strength. His
head is of gold but his feet are of clay, and who will be king
to-morrow?</p>

<p>And wondering, one looks up and up, above the mightiest of these kings,
and yet above the very summit of his crown, and there one sees&mdash;the

Hell Gate Bridge, through the Borough of Queens and Long Island City,
under the East River and half of Manhattan, to come to the surface at
the Pennsylvania Station. Hell Gate Bridge runs from above Port Morris
over Bronx Kills and Randall’s Island, across Little Hell Gate and
Ward’s Island, and last, with its huge span, over Hell Gate to Astoria
in Queens. It is six miles long. If laid over Manhattan it would reach
from Wanamaker’s store at Eighth Street, to One Hundred and Twenty-fifth

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
